# Road to v2

No matter how hard you try to create an app store that makes a little sense, you cannot do it effectively because in all the public collections there are not all apps (even and especially the most popular ones).

Furthermore, at this point in time in comparison with Snap and Flatpak, for appImage there is the lack of a simplified installation from a repository.

Even if the official appImage team does not seem to agree much with having a repository for appImage, it could be a useful tool.

A possible repository for appImage, however, must have a different structure by nature of appImage itself.

AppHub is considering creating a fully distributed and secure appImage repository. The possibility of using some blockchain and thus exploiting the security and distribution features of blockchain is being considered. 
In addition, signature systems (on and off blockchain) are being evaluated for e2e verification of the validity and originality of applications. Again, a system is being evaluated to allow each organisation/developer to publish, 
manage and version their applications as if they had their own repository (even if it is part of a larger repository). Everything will be made open source.

The idea under evaluation is to divide the work and deployment into three phases:
- phase one: the repository will be managed by the mainteiner (and a subset of selected people). During this phase, the development of a DAO will begin, which will enable the management of the repository in a decentralised manner.
- second phase: the first version of the DAO will be published, where it will be possible for everyone to participate in the community's choices. Only in this phase the DAO will be managed by the maintainer and a subset of selected persons. 
During this phase, the DAO will be monitored and the details of the next phase will be defined.
- Third phase: autonomy of the DAO, the maintainers will no longer be able to manage the DAO, which will be self-governing.

Currently we are working on a whitepaper that will be publish when ready. Stay tuned!
